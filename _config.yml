          During my time at BSUIR I learnt most of my key skills that I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I totally enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of time at hackathons and participated in many *startups* as an assistant.
